    <h1>Data(Bio)</h1>
    <p>I am a programming intern who works hard towards achieving a greater height as
         well as render services as a programmer. 
         <br>
        It’s my belief that I can do all it takes In the past few years, I’ve obtained a bachelor degree of art in modern European languages
         from the prestigious Nnamdi Azikiwe University as well as engaged in various programming
          courses and tasks through hard work and dedication.
          <br>
        I have a passion for programming but on the side, I also enjoy reading and traveling as well
         as surfing the net.
