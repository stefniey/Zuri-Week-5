    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Stephanie, I’m from Anambra state, Nigeria and I am a programmer.
      <br>
       I started programming because I have a strong passion for coding and wanted to inspire
        others to start coding too.
        <br>
         After many years of trying to find a job that reflected my love for European languages I decided to take matters
        into my own hands and start building,
        my world in the programming platform that can help fellow aspiring programmers learn their
         own way and achieve their dreams.
    </p>
